## Bitcoin price converter

This app is created, using React with Next.JS,

It shows current price of Bitcoin for different currency, like:

- USD
- GBP
- EUR

All information is taken from Coindesk API and stored in Redux store.
Price is refreshing automatically every minute.

For styling i've used Scss with all it features.

Mainly i've deployed it to Vercel to be able to check how it looks.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
